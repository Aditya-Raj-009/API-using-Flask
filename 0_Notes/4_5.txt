1) Create a folder "Controller".
2) move user_controller.py in this folder.

Now if we create multiple files under this folder
we need to import all files in app.py.
for this all we can do is :

from Controller import file1,file2,.. 

Above will work but  this will not work:
from Controller import *

 To do so we need to define this folder
as package. We can do this by creating 
a __init__.py file under this folder and need to 
write this cod:

__all__ = ['user_controller'] # we need to mention all files name available under this folder inside this array.


// now its work.

//But it may be a hectact if there is 100 files. So for this better to do this:

__all__ = [os.path.basename(fname)[:-3] for fname in glob.glob(os.path.dirname(__file__)+"/*.py")]
