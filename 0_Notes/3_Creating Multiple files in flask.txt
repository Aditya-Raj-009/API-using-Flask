we use here MVC (Model view controller)

start:

1) create a file name "user_controller.py".

this file contains code like we have created in app.py
Means our app.py is it self act as a controller.
But we also want if there is another files contains same type of code can also execute.

2):
user_controller.py:


from app import app     #importing app variable from app.py file

@app.route('/user/signup')
def signup():
    return 'This is Signup operation'


app.py:

from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/') # use to provide end point. As soon as the endpoint hit, the following fundtion under the decorater get executed.
def welcome():  # This function will run as soon as we enter into this endpoint.
    return "Hello World"

@app.route('/home')
def home():
    return 'welcome to my home'

import user_controller  #importing user_controller so that it reflect on page (site) becoz app.py works as an entry point of app.
