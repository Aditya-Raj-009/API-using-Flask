We learnt Put for update data in database.
But disadvantange of Put is that we always need to send whole data even if
we only want to update only a single unit.
Let's say you want to update only email.But when you use Put i.e.
when you send request to update email using put, you need to send whole column including id.

So for this we have another http function which is use to update that is 
Patch. By this we only send the data that is to be changed and its id.

To know more difference between these 2: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-put-and-patch-request/



# patch:

@app.route('/user/patch/<id>',methods=['PATCH'])
def user_patch_controller(id):
    obj = user_model()
    return obj.user_patch_model(request.form,id)


 # patch:
    
    def user_patch_model(self,data,id):
        # NORMAL UPDATE QUERY: update users set column1 = value1, column2 = value2,.. where id = someid

        # little change when we use patch method:
        qry = "UPDATE users SET"
        for key in data:    # we can send any number of update value.
            qry = f"{qry} {key}='{data[key]}', "

        qry = qry.removesuffix(', ') # remove last ','
        qry+=f' where id = {id}'

        self.cur.execute(qry)

        if self.cur.rowcount>0:
            return {'message':'User updated successfully'}
        return {'message':'Nothing to update'}
