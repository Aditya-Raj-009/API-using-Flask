Delete:

for delete we only need id of user which we want to delete.
So for this we don't need to send id by form.
We send id through url only:
http://127.0.0.1:5000/user/delete/3     // we send it from postman using delete method
here at last '3' is id.

Now how we recieve it in our python code:

@app.route('/user/delete/<id>',methods=['DELETE']) # here, <id> is a url variable which we use to recieve id through url.
def user_delete_controller(id): # take id.
    obj = user_model()
    return obj.user_delete_model(id)


# Delete: in model class:

    def user_delete_model(self, id):
        self.cur.execute(f"DELETE FROM users WHERE ID={id}")
        if self.cur.rowcount>0:
            return "User Deleted Successfully"
        return "Nothing to delete"
