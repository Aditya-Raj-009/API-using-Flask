To implement JWT , we need to do some modification on our database because
in our database till now we have only one table that is 'users'

Users table contains email and password , and we use it as credential for loggin.

Process of make the user loggin called Authentication.
After the Authentication next step is Authorization.
Authorization means to check whether this particular user has authority to access
the resource from the particular server.

So, To what table we are going to add and what changes we'll made in exiting table:

We add another table to our db that is "Roles".

Roles Table: id (primary key), title (we give first default title as 'super admin').

Suppose we are making e-learning app. So, in this we can different roles like:
instructor,learner,moderator.

Now, we add another table 'Endpoint'.
It contains: id (primary key) , Endpoint,methods (get,put,etc):
 /video/upload   Post
 /course/create  Post
 /course/getall  Get

Now to give access of Endpoint to the Roles that is which role can access which endpoint.
for eg: /video/upload this endpoint can only be access by Instructor,
Similarly, /course/getall can be access by everyone (moderator,instructor and learner)

So to do so we need to make another table 'Accessibility':
id(primary key), endpoint_id (foreign key) , Roles.
1                   3                       [1,2,3,4] all four can access because 3rd endpoint is /course/getall.
2                   1                       [2] only instructor can access.


We have: Users table
we add one more column: role_id (foreign key) and also delete 'role' column from 
users table because we don't need this.
