creating an endpoint to read the files.

in our database file are save like this:

uploads/1711001459305581.jpg

so, we cannot directly put it into the browser because it has no base url.

So, in this case  frontend developer need to fetch the app like this:
let he have a domain "myapp.com".
And my api is link like this: api.myapp.com.

so to fetch data he need to send http request like this:
api.myapp.com/endpoint. endpoint can be /user, /user/getall/, user/addone/ etc



user_controller:

from flask import send_file

#  fetch file:
@app.route("/uploads/<fileName>")
def user_getAvatar_controller(fileName):
    return send_file(f"uploads/{fileName}")
