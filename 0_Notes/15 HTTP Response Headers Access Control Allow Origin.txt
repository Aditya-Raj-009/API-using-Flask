'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header: 

let's your api is linked with some domain on server and name is aditya.com.
And Application (Frontend) is linked with some other domain called myapp.com.

So, when I send a request from my application to api this is called cross origin request.

And this cross origin request are by default blocked by browser.
To make it allow, In our server set environment (in our case its flask environment), we
need associate a http response code which is called 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header.

and we put it value as '*', it means allow  (means allow request no matter from which origin it's coming.) request
from wherever its coming.


 def user_getall_model(self):
        self.cur.execute("SELECT * FROM users")
        result  = self.cur.fetchall()
        print(result)
        self.cur.close()
        if len(result)>0:
            res = make_response({"payload":result},200)
            res.headers['Access-Control-Allow-Origin'] = '*'  # adding header
            return  res
        return make_response({"message":"No data found"},204) # 204: for no content found.
    

    now to see, goto postman ,
    then at bottom you see a 'header' tab click it.
    Now when you send request, you can see 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' in header.
