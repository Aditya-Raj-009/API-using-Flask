2) create a user_model.py file inside this folder.
3) Now write code:
class user_model:
    def user_signup_model(self):
        return "This is signup operation"


user_controller.py:


from app import app
from model.user_model import user_model

obj = user_model()

@app.route('/user/signup')
def user_signup_controller():
    return obj.user_signup_model()

user_signup_model method , which return a string. This will use as data to show on page
or use on view.
