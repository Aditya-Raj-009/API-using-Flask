Now lets go and create tables which we had discussed in last note.

to update in users table to add roles's id as foreign key:
1) add column 'role_id' make it INT type and then apply and finish to save.
2) now to make this column (role_id) as foreign key, click below 'foreign key' tab.
then, give foreign key name, then select referenced table as 'flask_tutorial'.'roles'.

Then at right side, you see users tables's column, you select role_id, then id of roles table.

then in right side you'll see a tab 'foreign key option' from here you select,
'On update' as cascade.
cascade: so that if we update role id in role table it automaticaly update in users table.
Now , click on apply and finish.

whether the cascading is work or not:
lets add a row in role table:
let add title as 'super admin'. then apply and finish.

also add id of super admin to the role_id column in users to whom you want to make super admin.
then click apply and finish.

Now when you update id of super admin it will reflect in users's role_id column.


Now lets create Endpoints table:
id (pk,not null, ai), Endpoints, methods
then add some Endpoints, from here like '\users\getall and so on.


Now lets create Accessibility table:

id(Int,pk,nn,ai), endpoint_id (Int), roles (long text, so that we can add array type or json type long value).

now in same way we make endpoint_id as foreign key.
